# osTicket-Creating-and-Working-Tickets
In this project I go through the life cycle of a ticket from creation, to resolution. I make changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets, changing the SLA, and commenting to create a thread of clear communication. This is a continuation of osTicket: Post Installation Configuration.
